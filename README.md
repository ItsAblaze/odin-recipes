Elis To Die For Meals 

This site will list a few recipes that I would die for, these are 10/10 if found at the right place.

Other than to show off a few great meals I grew up on or have just learned to love, this is also a great opportunity to show off a few of the newer or refined skills I've picked up following The Odin Project :D

By the end of this I should be able to clearly show how to properly start git projects, properly set up html and possible css files, efficently utilize git staging and commiting with comments, and more.
