    <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>
    <li>16 ounces tomato sauce, divided</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

    <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
    <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
    <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
