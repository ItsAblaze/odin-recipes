<h3>Pastel de tres leches is a sponge cake that's steeped in three kinds of milk: condensed, evaporated, and heavy cream. The soaked cake is served with whipped cream and sliced fresh strawberries. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.</h3>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>Cake:</h3>
    <li>6 medium eggs, separated</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

    <h3>Tres Leches:</h3>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream (Optional)</li>

    <h3>For serving:</h3>
    <li>1 cup whipped cream (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries (Optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Make the cake: Beat egg whites in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar until mixture is glossy. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce the speed to medium and mix in flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix in milk, baking powder, and vanilla. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make the tres leches: Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and cream in a blender. Pulse several times until well blended.</li>
    <li>Pour tres leches over cake. Cover and refrigerate until cake is cold and all liquid has been absorbed at least 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Cut chilled cake into 12 squares. Top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a few sliced strawberries.</li>
    
</ol>
